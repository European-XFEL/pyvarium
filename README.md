# Pyvarium

Usage:

1. `pyvarium setup poetry /path/to/poetry`
2. `pyvarium setup spack /path/to/spack`
3. `pyvarium new /path/to/env /path/to/poetry /path/to/spack`
4.

TODO:
- Work on creating a spack hook which runs sync after python packages are installed
- Add copying that hook into spack to `pyvarium setup spack`
- Work on hook that does git commits and pushes automatically
- Use named environments instead of anonymous ones
